-I am interested in stuffs that can help our daily lives through technology. Anything that can help us do things we normally do, easier though with technology. I've been a consultant software developer for years with companies before. I, too been hit with struggles, with pandemic of covid-19, our companies was forced to close. Made apps for them; they use the apps and I updated them regularly. Sadly though, lost all my active jobs. Strived to survive. Now on my venture to exist in our online world, seeking career and hoping to stay in a company with their ups and downs, I will help with all my efforts to anyone who might need my service. I think that’s what people should do, for me at least, to a company that was feeding my family, especially my only princess(daughter).

-I am currently learning Laravel because I was ignoring it before when I was working, started every projects from scratch and work my way up to my client needs. I don’t know if it is productive to do both learning laravel and machine coding for IO boards like Arduino UNO to make thing automated for smart houses, or robots. Currently installed solar for our house with voice command lights and voice command unlock of door through my phone, because I always forget my keys in my car.

-I’m looking to collaborate on anyone who have the same interest like me, feel free to contact me through email -> aaronmagpantay@gmail.com
